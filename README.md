# coop_repo
This is the Cooperative Driving repo by Rodolfo Valiente Romero & Behrad Toghi

Temporary instructions:
To run:
`python scripts/rl_agents_scripts/debugger.py`

You can add as many configs or options you want in this file, just chosse different names, e.g., `options_1`, `options_2`, etc.

This is a wrapper around the `experiment.py` file so we can easily run different options and configs for debugging purposes.
